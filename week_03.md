ASSIGNMENT 3

Last week we asked you to undertake some initial research excursions, to collect inspiration material, to find starting points within this very open "create a city" project. This week's assignment builds on this, but we ask you to look deeper and be more systematic.




Due start of class, W3
Informed by one or two key ideas derived from your first excursions and subsequent discussion and analysis, we ask you to go out again and collect materials to generate a "collection of parts".

Think of the collection as building blocks, but not necessarily a physical construction set which fits together. These collections should each be about one very particular idea or topic. They could be collections of physical objects (miniscule or giant), living things, systems, signage, built things, natural occurrences, nebulous entities, intentional interventions ...  You should be deliberate about your choice of media and visual vocabulary as you communicate your collection. Consider: What are you isolating, foregrounding, abstracting, erasing, redrawing, amplifying, as you build your collections? What are you drawing our attention towards? Consider the idea of “unseen” parts. What creative strategies are you employing? E.g., Formal Analyses (of words, images, impressions, etc.). Write a letter to an object/non-object, circumstance/situation

Work individually to answer the above assignment, but we expect you to work together to coordinate travel logistics.
All group members should upload their individual collections to the group Miro board
